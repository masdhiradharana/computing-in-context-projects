## Welcome to Mas's Python Projects

This page contains all the projects I completed during the second half of the Computing in Context course at SIPA, Columbia University. I would like to thank Prof. Aidan Feldman and all the TAs for all the guidance through out the semester. Please enjoy the read, and if you have any feedback or questions, feel free to send an email to md4204@columbia.edu.
